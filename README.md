# Getting Started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Install project dependecies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

### Assumptions

1. Since no tools were specify, i used Reactjs for the assessment since it can be used to build stic appliactions.
2. I used Chartjs for the chart, because is simple and fast to setup.
